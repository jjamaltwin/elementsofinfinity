            Keleisha S Milons Dubuque, Iowa ~ For The Love or Money<br></br>
            When I tell y‚Äôall I was going through it I mean that. While catching
            up with my long time friend Aminah Infinity she heard my cries, she
            suggested her book, told me to check it out. Whew Lord when I say
            her book found me‚Ä¶ everything happens for a reason and the universe
            was right on time with this alignment! It is nothing short of
            amazing. I didn‚Äôt put it down. It has opened up so many things in me
            that I didn‚Äôt even know existed. It is more than a one time read and
            on the shelf it goes‚Ä¶. It STAYS on my nightstand. I go back to it
            almost daily. This book literally has changed my life!

            Kelly Marie Dubuue, IA ~ For The Love or Money <br></br>I read this
            book and could not put it down. It brought to light some many
            battles I was fighting internally. This book has opened up my eye
            and helped me ascend to a higher vibration I did not know existed.
            It is a GREAT self development book. EVERYONE should read this book.
            I also have Prosperity Oil as well. It smells soooo good. Next on my
            list is the love oil. I can‚Äôt wait to embrace that one. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Much
            love to Aminah Infinity. She is truly an amazing soul.

            Keleisha S Milons Dubuque, Iowa ~ 333 Affirmations Workbook<br></br>
            üó£üó£ This book, to me its so much more than that. This Queen Dale
            Carroll doesn't know how much this yellow blessing has changed my
            life! It has made me a better person but most importantly a better
            mother. I left a toxic relationship not knowing what was ahead of me
            2 years ago. It took some time, self love and hardwork to get rid of
            that negative mindset. I knew I had to show my girls a better way, I
            knew I had to do and be better. Seeing and hearing my babies speak
            life into themselves daily is an undescribable feeling. I never knew
            how powerful our tongues are and how what you speak is what you will
            recieve. I know now and I love passing this down to my kids. Long
            story short if you don't have her books go get them TODAY!! The
            universe provides you with everything you need. I didn't know I
            NEEDED this blessing and I am beyond grateful for you QueenüôåüèΩüôèüèΩ
